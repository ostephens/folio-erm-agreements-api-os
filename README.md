# Folio ERM Agreements OpenAPI Definition

## Working on your OpenAPI Definition

### Install

1. Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Clone this repo and run `npm install` in the repo root.

### Usage

#### `npm start`
Starts the reference docs preview server.

#### `npm run build`
Bundles the definition to the dist folder.

#### `npm test`
Validates the definition.

### Schemas

#### Adding Schemas

1. Navigate to the `openapi/components/schemas` folder.
2. Add a file named as you wish to name the schema.
3. Define the schema.
4. Refer to the schema using the `$ref`.

#### Editing Schemas

1. Navigate to the `openapi/components/schemas` folder.
2. Open the file you wish to edit.
3. Edit.

### Paths

#### Adding a Path

1. Navigate to the `openapi/paths` folder.
2. Add a new YAML file named like your URL endpoint except replacing `/` with `@` and putting path parameters into curly braces like `{example}`.
3. Add the path and a ref to it inside of your `openapi.yaml` file inside of the `openapi` folder.

Example addition to the `openapi.yaml` file:
```yaml
'/customers/{id}':
  $ref: './paths/customers@{id}.yaml'
```

Here is an example of a YAML file named `customers@{id}.yaml` in the `paths` folder:

```yaml
get:
  tags:
    - Customers
  summary: Retrieve a list of customers
  operationId: GetCustomerCollection
  description: |
    You can have a markdown description here.
  parameters:
    - $ref: ../components/parameters/collectionLimit.yaml
    - $ref: ../components/parameters/collectionOffset.yaml
    - $ref: ../components/parameters/collectionFilter.yaml
    - $ref: ../components/parameters/collectionQuery.yaml
    - $ref: ../components/parameters/collectionExpand.yaml
    - $ref: ../components/parameters/collectionFields.yaml
  responses:
    '200':
      description: A list of Customers was retrieved successfully
      headers:
        Rate-Limit-Limit:
          $ref: ../components/headers/Rate-Limit-Limit.yaml
        Rate-Limit-Remaining:
          $ref: ../components/headers/Rate-Limit-Remaining.yaml
        Rate-Limit-Reset:
          $ref: ../components/headers/Rate-Limit-Reset.yaml
        Pagination-Total:
          $ref: ../components/headers/Pagination-Total.yaml
        Pagination-Limit:
          $ref: ../components/headers/Pagination-Limit.yaml
        Pagination-Offset:
          $ref: ../components/headers/Pagination-Offset.yaml
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            type: array
            items:
              $ref: ../components/schemas/Customer.yaml
        text/csv:
          schema:
            type: array
            items:
              $ref: ../components/schemas/Customer.yaml
    '401':
      $ref: ../components/responses/AccessForbidden.yaml
  x-code-samples:
    - lang: PHP
      source:
        $ref: ../code_samples/PHP/customers/get.php
post:
  tags:
    - Customers
  summary: Create a customer (without an ID)
  operationId: PostCustomer
  description: Another markdown description here.
  requestBody:
    $ref: ../components/requestBodies/Customer.yaml
  responses:
    '201':
      $ref: ../components/responses/Customer.yaml
    '401':
      $ref: ../components/responses/AccessForbidden.yaml
    '409':
      $ref: ../components/responses/Conflict.yaml
    '422':
      $ref: ../components/responses/InvalidDataError.yaml
  x-code-samples:
    - lang: PHP
      source:
        $ref: ../code_samples/PHP/customers/post.php
```

You'll see extensive usage of `$ref`s in this example to different types of components including schemas.

You'll also notice `$ref`s to code samples.
